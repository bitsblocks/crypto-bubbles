About Nouriel Roubini

My name is Nouriel Roubini and I am a Professor of Economics at the
Stern School of Business at New York University. I am an expert of the
global economy, international financial markets, asset and credit
bubbles and their bust, and the related financial crises. I was one of the
few economists warning about and predicting in advance the Global
Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 and I am one of the leading global scholars
on the topic of bubbles and financial crises. My most recent book
"Crisis Economics: A Crash Course in the Future of Finance" is a seminal
treatise on the topic of asset bubbles and financial crises. I have written
dozens of papers and other contributions on the topic of bubbles and
their bust and the causes and consequences of financial crises.



## Crypto Bubble (2017) and Crypto Apocalypse and Bust (2018)

It is clear by now that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies represent the
mother of all bubbles, which explains why literally every human being I
met between Thanksgiving and Christmas of 2017 asked me first if they
should buy them. Especially folks with zero financial literacy –
individuals who could not tell the difference between stocks and bonds –
went into a literal manic frenzy of Bitcoin and Crypto buying.
Scammers, swindlers, criminals, charlatans, insider whales and carnival
barkers (all conflicted insiders) tapped into clueless retail investors'
FOMO ("fear of missing out"), and took them for a ride selling them and
dumping on them scammy crappy assets at the peak that then went
into a bust and crash – in a matter of months - like you have not seen in
any history of financial bubbles.

A chart of Bitcoin prices compared to other famous historical bubbles
and scams – like Tulip-mania, the Mississippi Bubble, the South Sea
Bubble – shows that the price increase of Bitcoin and other crypto junkcoins was 2X or 3X bigger than previous bubbles and the ensuing
collapse and bust as fast and furious and deeper. Bitcoin rapidly
exploded in 2017 from $1k to 10K and then peaked almost at $20K in
December 2017 only to collapse to below $6k (down 70% from that
peak) in a matter of four months and it has been close to $6k since
then. And a 70% capital loss was a "good" deal compared to thousands
of alt-coins (otherwise better known as shitcoins) that have lost on
average 95% of their value since the peak. Actually calling this useless
vaporware garbage a "shitcoin" is a grave insult to manure that is a
most useful, precious and productive good as a fertilizer in agriculture.[^1]

[^1]: My apologies to the members of the Senate Banking Committee for using the scatological term "shitcoin" but the
term is standard in the crypto jargon and there are more than 500000 references to it in a Google search of this
technical term. See: <https://www.google.com/search?q=shitcoin>



Now that the crypto bloodbath is in full view the new refuge of the
crypto scoundrels is "blockchain", the technology underlying crypto
that is now alleged to be the cure of all global problems, including
poverty, famines and even diseases. But as discussed in detail below
blockchain is the most over-hyped - and least useful - technology in
human history: in practice it is nothing better than a glorified
spreadsheet or database.

The entire crypto-currency land has now gone into a crypto-apocalypse
as the mother and father of all bubbles has now gone bust. Since the
peak of the bubble late last year Bitcoin has fallen by about 70% in
value (depending on the week). And that is generous. Other leading
crypto-currencies such as Ether, EOS, Litecoin, XRP have fallen by over
80% (or more depending on the week). While thousands of other
crypto-currencies – literally scam-coins and scam-tokens – have fallen
in value between 90% and 99%. No wonder as a recent study showed
that 81% of all ICOs were scams in the first place, 11% of them are dead
or failing while only 8% of them are traded in exchanges. And out of
this 8% the top 10 coins traded – after Bitcoin – have lost between 83%
and 95% of their value since peak with an average loss of over 90%. This
is a true Crypt-Apocalypse. No wonder that a recent study this week
argued and conclude that the crypto industry is on the "brink of an
implosion".[^2]

No asset class in human history has ever experienced such a rapid
boom and total utter bust and implosion that includes thousands of
different crypto-assets.

## Crypto is not money, not scalable

To be a currency, Bitcoin – or any crypto-currencies - should be a
serviceable unit of account, means of payments, and a stable store of
value. It is none of those things. No one prices anything in Bitcoin. Few
retailers accept it. And it is a poor store of value, because its price can
fluctuate by 20-30% in a single day. And since its price has been so
unstable or volatile almost no merchant will ever use it as a means of
payment: the profit margin of any merchant can be wiped out in a
matter of minutes – if he or she accepts Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency –by the change in the dollar price of a crypto-currency. Proper
means of payments need to have stable purchasing power; otherwise
no one will ever use them.


As is typical of a financial bubble, investors were buying
cryptocurrencies not to use in transactions, but because they expected
them to increase in value. Indeed, if someone actually wanted to use
Bitcoin, they would have a hard time doing so. It is so 
[energy-intensive (and thus environmentally toxic) to produce](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/21/technology/bitcoin-mining-energy-consumption.html), and carries such high
transaction costs, that even Bitcoin conferences [do not accept it](https://slate.com/technology/2018/01/the-most-important-blockchain-conference-of-the-year-wont-take-bitcoin-for-last-minute-sales.html) as a
valid form of payment. Paying $55 dollars of transaction costs to buy a
$2 coffee cup is obviously never going to lead Bitcoin to become a
transaction currency.


Until now, Bitcoin's only real use has been to facilitate illegal activities
such as drug transactions, tax evasion, avoidance of capital controls, or
money laundering. Not surprisingly, G20 member states are now
working together to regulate cryptocurrencies and eliminate the
anonymity they supposedly afford, by requiring that all income - or
capital-gains-generating transactions be reported. Even the US Treasury
Secretary Steve Mnuchin has publicly stated that we cannot allow
crypto-currencies to become the next Swiss bank account. 

Since the invention of money thousands of years ago, there has never
been a monetary system with hundreds of different currencies
operating alongside one another. The entire point of money is that it
allows parties to transact without having to barter. But for money to
have value, and to generate economies of scale, only so many
currencies can operate at the same time.

In the US, the reason we do not use euros or yen in addition to dollars
is obvious: doing so would be pointless, and it would make the
economy far less efficient. The idea that hundreds of cryptocurrencies
could viably operate together not only contradicts the very concept of
money with a single numeraire that can be used for the price discovery
of the relative price of thousands of good; it is utterly idiotic as the use
of multiple numeraires is like the stone age of barter before money was
created.

## Supply of crypto is massive. Bitcoin is deflationary





## Financial crises occurred well before fiat currencies and central banking; and are now less virulent thanks to central banks and fiat money.

...

## The real revolution in financial services is FinTech and it has nothing to do with Blockchain or Crypto

...

## Buterin's inconsistent trinity: crypto is not scalable, is not decentralized, is not secure

...

## No security in crypto-currencies

...

## Decentralization is a self-serving ideology

...

## Decentralization is a myth: massive centralization and concentration of oligopolistic power and cartels among miners, exchanges, developers, wealth holders

...

## Crypto is not the internet nor will ever be

...

## ICOs are not compliant securities when they aren't outright scams

...

## Tokenization: cartels aimed to gouge consumers. No numeraire and return to barter

...

## Massive manipulation: pump n dump, spoofing, wash trading, front running, exchanges conflicts of interest, tether scam

...

## No Killer App in Crypto/Blockchain After A Decade: Only Ponzi Schemes

...

## The energy consumption of crypto is an environmental disaster

...

## Blockchain is most overhyped technology ever, no better than a glorified spreadsheet or database

...

## Enterprise DLT/Blockchain: All hype and no reality

## Crypto is corrupt eco-system full of charlatans, con-men, self-interested insiders and scammers. But I have NO conflict of interest

Crypto-land is an eco-system of con artists, self-serving peddlers,
scammers, carnival barkers, charlatans, and outright criminals. While
every successful technological revolution includes some bubbles and
some scammers, most of the real ones – like the internet - create real
goods and services that billions of folks use around the world even after
the initial frothiness and bubble has burst. And the criminal and
scamming element in real technological revolutions is the exception,
not the systemic rule that it is in crypto land. Scams in crypto-currencies
were so widespread and systemic that the SEC had to create a fake
website that parodies the scammy ICO to warns investors of the
plethora of scams and criminal enterprises that infest and dominate
crypto land.[^18]

[^18]: The SEC created a fake ICO website to show just how easy it is to scam investors, See: <https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-sec-created-a-mock-ico-website-to-show-just-how-easy-it-is-forinvestors-to-get-fleeced-2018-05-16>


This scammy eco-system is consistent with the idiotic crypto jargon:
HODLers are suckers who have hold on their collapsing cryptocurrencies even after they lost 90% of their value; Lambos refer to the
crypto obsession with stealing investors' money to buy luxury energy
hogging cars; Whales are large early crypto billionaires who are stuck
with their fake wealth after the suckers of retails investors – who
bought into the FOMO of the peak 2017 bubbles – lost 90% of their
investments; those suckers are also called BagHolders. The entire
crypto jargon is not of a new industry developing a creative disruptive
technology but that of an industry of con artists, criminals, scammers
and carnival barkers.

Unlike all self-interested crypto insiders and scammers who talk and
spin their book 24/7 and use a media/press eco-system of pseudo -
journalists to spin their endless fake news I have zero position and
financial interest in this entire space. I have zero long or short position
in any coin or crypto-currency and any blockchain business venture.
And even my support of non-blockchain fin-tech is not driven from any
direct or indirect financial interest; I have zero exposure to fin-tech
ventures. Bitcoin or any crypto-asset could go "To The Moon" or crash
to zero and I would not make a penny either way. The only thing that is
at stake is my personal, intellectual and academic reputation.
