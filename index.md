About Nouriel Roubini

My name is Nouriel Roubini and I am a Professor of Economics at the
Stern School of Business at New York University. I am an expert of the
global economy, international financial markets, asset and credit
bubbles and their bust, and the related financial crises. I was one of the
few economists warning about and predicting in advance the Global
Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 and I am one of the leading global scholars
on the topic of bubbles and financial crises. My most recent book
"Crisis Economics: A Crash Course in the Future of Finance" is a seminal
treatise on the topic of asset bubbles and financial crises. I have written
dozens of papers and other contributions on the topic of bubbles and
their bust and the causes and consequences of financial crises.



## Crypto Bubble (2017) and Crypto Apocalypse and Bust (2018)

It is clear by now that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies represent the
mother of all bubbles, which explains why literally every human being I
met between Thanksgiving and Christmas of 2017 asked me first if they
should buy them. Especially folks with zero financial literacy –
individuals who could not tell the difference between stocks and bonds –
went into a literal manic frenzy of Bitcoin and Crypto buying.
Scammers, swindlers, criminals, charlatans, insider whales and carnival
barkers (all conflicted insiders) tapped into clueless retail investors'
FOMO ("fear of missing out"), and took them for a ride selling them and
dumping on them scammy crappy assets at the peak that then went
into a bust and crash – in a matter of months - like you have not seen in
any history of financial bubbles.

A chart of Bitcoin prices compared to other famous historical bubbles
and scams – like Tulip-mania, the Mississippi Bubble, the South Sea
Bubble – shows that the price increase of Bitcoin and other crypto junkcoins was 2X or 3X bigger than previous bubbles and the ensuing
collapse and bust as fast and furious and deeper. Bitcoin rapidly
exploded in 2017 from $1k to 10K and then peaked almost at $20K in
December 2017 only to collapse to below $6k (down 70% from that
peak) in a matter of four months and it has been close to $6k since
then. And a 70% capital loss was a "good" deal compared to thousands
of alt-coins (otherwise better known as shitcoins) that have lost on
average 95% of their value since the peak. Actually calling this useless
vaporware garbage a "shitcoin" is a grave insult to manure that is a
most useful, precious and productive good as a fertilizer in agriculture.[^1]

[^1]: My apologies to the members of the Senate Banking Committee for using the scatological term "shitcoin" but the
term is standard in the crypto jargon and there are more than 500000 references to it in a Google search of this
technical term. See: <https://www.google.com/search?q=shitcoin>



Now that the crypto bloodbath is in full view the new refuge of the
crypto scoundrels is "blockchain", the technology underlying crypto
that is now alleged to be the cure of all global problems, including
poverty, famines and even diseases. But as discussed in detail below
blockchain is the most over-hyped - and least useful - technology in
human history: in practice it is nothing better than a glorified
spreadsheet or database.

The entire crypto-currency land has now gone into a crypto-apocalypse
as the mother and father of all bubbles has now gone bust. Since the
peak of the bubble late last year Bitcoin has fallen by about 70% in
value (depending on the week). And that is generous. Other leading
crypto-currencies such as Ether, EOS, Litecoin, XRP have fallen by over
80% (or more depending on the week). While thousands of other
crypto-currencies – literally scam-coins and scam-tokens – have fallen
in value between 90% and 99%. No wonder as a recent study showed
that 81% of all ICOs were scams in the first place, 11% of them are dead
or failing while only 8% of them are traded in exchanges. And out of
this 8% the top 10 coins traded – after Bitcoin – have lost between 83%
and 95% of their value since peak with an average loss of over 90%. This
is a true Crypt-Apocalypse. No wonder that a recent study this week
argued and conclude that the crypto industry is on the "brink of an
implosion".[^2]

No asset class in human history has ever experienced such a rapid
boom and total utter bust and implosion that includes thousands of
different crypto-assets.

## Crypto is not money, not scalable

To be a currency, Bitcoin – or any crypto-currencies - should be a
serviceable unit of account, means of payments, and a stable store of
value. It is none of those things. No one prices anything in Bitcoin. Few
retailers accept it. And it is a poor store of value, because its price can
fluctuate by 20-30% in a single day. And since its price has been so
unstable or volatile almost no merchant will ever use it as a means of
payment: the profit margin of any merchant can be wiped out in a
matter of minutes – if he or she accepts Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency –by the change in the dollar price of a crypto-currency. Proper
means of payments need to have stable purchasing power; otherwise
no one will ever use them.


As is typical of a financial bubble, investors were buying
cryptocurrencies not to use in transactions, but because they expected
them to increase in value. Indeed, if someone actually wanted to use
Bitcoin, they would have a hard time doing so. It is so 
[energy-intensive (and thus environmentally toxic) to produce](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/21/technology/bitcoin-mining-energy-consumption.html), and carries such high
transaction costs, that even Bitcoin conferences [do not accept it](https://slate.com/technology/2018/01/the-most-important-blockchain-conference-of-the-year-wont-take-bitcoin-for-last-minute-sales.html) as a
valid form of payment. Paying $55 dollars of transaction costs to buy a
$2 coffee cup is obviously never going to lead Bitcoin to become a
transaction currency.


Until now, Bitcoin's only real use has been to facilitate illegal activities
such as drug transactions, tax evasion, avoidance of capital controls, or
money laundering. Not surprisingly, G20 member states are now
working together to regulate cryptocurrencies and eliminate the
anonymity they supposedly afford, by requiring that all income - or
capital-gains-generating transactions be reported. Even the US Treasury
Secretary Steve Mnuchin has publicly stated that we cannot allow
crypto-currencies to become the next Swiss bank account. 

Since the invention of money thousands of years ago, there has never
been a monetary system with hundreds of different currencies
operating alongside one another. The entire point of money is that it
allows parties to transact without having to barter. But for money to
have value, and to generate economies of scale, only so many
currencies can operate at the same time.

In the US, the reason we do not use euros or yen in addition to dollars
is obvious: doing so would be pointless, and it would make the
economy far less efficient. The idea that hundreds of cryptocurrencies
could viably operate together not only contradicts the very concept of
money with a single numeraire that can be used for the price discovery
of the relative price of thousands of good; it is utterly idiotic as the use
of multiple numeraires is like the stone age of barter before money was
created.


## Supply of crypto is massive. Bitcoin is deflationary

But so, too, is the idea that even a single cryptocurrency could
substitute for fiat money. Cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value,
whereas fiat currencies certainly do, because they can be used to pay
taxes. Fiat currencies are legal tender and can be used and are used to
buy any good or service; and they can be used to pay for tax liabilities.
They are also protected from value debasement by central banks
committed to price stability; and if a fiat currency loses credibility, as in
some weak monetary systems with high inflation, it will be swapped
out for more stable foreign fiat currencies – like the dollar or the euro -
or real assets such as real estate, equities and possibly gold. Fiat money
also is not created out of thin air: these liabilities of a central bank such
as the Fed are backed by the Fed assets: their holdings of short term
and longer term Treasury securities (that have near AAA sovereign
credit status in the US) and holding of foreign reserves including gold
and other stable foreign currencies. The usual crypto critique of fiat
currencies that can be debased via inflation is nonsense: for the last 30
years commitment to inflation targeting in advanced economies and
most emerging markets has led to price stability (the 2% inflation target
of most central banks) and for the last decade the biggest problem of
central banks has been that achieving the inflation target of 2% after
the GFC has become extremely difficult as, in spite of unconventional
monetary policies, the inflation rate has systematically undershot its 2%
target.

Instead 99.9% all crypto-currencies instead have no backing whatsoever
of any sort and have no intrinsic value of any sort; and even the socalled "stable coins" have only partial backing at best with true US
dollars reserves or, like Tether, most likely no backing at all as there has
never been a proper audit of their accounts. 

As it happens, Bitcoin's supposed advantage is also its Achilles's heel,
because even if it actually did have a steady-state supply of 21 million
units, that would disqualify it as a viable currency. Unless the supply of
a currency tracks potential nominal GDP, prices will undergo deflation.

That means if a steady - state supply of Bitcoin really did gradually
replace a fiat currency, the price index of all goods and services would
continuously fall. By extension, any nominal debt contract denominated
in Bitcoin would rise in real value over time, leading to the kind of debt 
deflation that economist Irving Fisher believed [precipitated](https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/users/jcalhoun/Courses/Growth_of_American_Economy/Chapter_Supplemental_Readings/Chapter_23/Fisher-The_Debt_Deflation_Theory.pdf) the Great
Depression. At the same time, nominal wages in Bitcoin would increase
forever in real terms, regardless of productivity growth, adding further
to the likelihood of an economic disaster.

Worse, cryptocurrencies in general are based on a false premise.
According to its promoters, Bitcoin has a steady-state supply of 21
million units, so it cannot be debased like fiat currencies. But that claim
is clearly fraudulent, considering that it has already forked off into
several branches and spin-offs: Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. Ditto for
the various forks and spin-off of Ether from the Ethereum cartel. It took
a century for Coca Cola to create the new Coke and call the old one
Coke Classic. But it took three years to Ethereum to dump the first ETH
into Ethereum Classic and create and brand new spin-off, ETH. 

Moreover, hundreds of other cryptocurrencies are invented every day,
alongside scams known as "initial coin offerings," which are mostly
designed to [skirt securities laws](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/01/23/2197970/ico-regulator-anger-translator/). And their supply is created and
debased every day by pure fiat and in the most arbitrary way. So
crypto-currencies are creating crypto money supply and debasing it at a
much faster pace than any major central bank ever has. No wonder that
the average crypto-currency has lost 95% of its value in a matter of a
year. 

At least in the case of Bitcoin the increase in supply is controlled by a
rigorous mining process and the supply is capped – at the limit – to 21
million bitcoins. Instead, most other alt-coins starting with the leading
ETH, have an arbitrary supply that was created via pre-mining and presale; and the change of supply of that and thousands of other cryptocurrencies is now subject to arbitrary decision of self-appointed
"central bankers". 

And the biggest scam of all is the case of "stable coins" – starting with
Tether – that claimed to be pegged one to one to the US dollar but are 
not fully collateralized by an equal backing of true US dollars. Bitfinex -
behind the scammy Tether – has persistently refused to be properly
audited and its creation of fiat Tether has been systematically used to
prop up manipulate upward the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies according to a recent academic paper. [^3]

## Financial crises occurred well before fiat currencies and central banking; and are now less virulent thanks to central banks and fiat money.


Another totally false argument is that asset and credit bubbles are
caused by central banks and the existence of fiat currencies. Any
student of financial crises knows that asset and credit bubbles were
widespread before fiat currencies and central banks were created; see
for example Tulipmania, the Mississipi Bubble and the South Sea
Bubble. These bubbles and their busts were frequent, virulent and had
massive economic and financial costs including severe recessions,
deflations, defaults and financial crisis.

Central banks – instead – were initially created not to provide goods
price stability but rather to provide financial stability and avoid
the destructive bank, sovereign and currency runs that do occur when a
bubble goes bust. Indeed, the Fed was created in 1913 when the last of
many bubbles gone bust that had caused massive bank runs led to the
realization that an institution that could provide with lender of last
resort to the financial system was needed. That and the creation of
deposit insurance after the Great Depression is the reason why bank
runs are so rare. And the purpose of fiat currencies whose supply is
regulated by credible and independent central bank is to reduce the
frequency, virulence and severity of economic recessions, deflations
and asset and credit bubbles gone bust. And indeed the economic and
financial history of US and other countries shows that severe economic
recessions, depressions, deflations and financial crises are less frequent
and less costly after the creation of fiat currencies and central banks.

Crypto-currencies instead have not and will never have the tools to
pursue economic and financial stability. The few like Bitcoin whose
supply is truly constrained by an arbitrary mathematical rule will never
be able to stabilize recessions, deflations and financial crises; they will
rather lead to permanent and pernicious deflation. While the rest –
99% - have an arbitrary supply generation mechanism that is worse
than any fiat currency and, at the same time, will never be able to
provide either economic or price or financial stability. They will rather
be tools of massive financial instability if their use were to become
widespread.

## Crypto is corrupt eco-system full of charlatans, con-men, self-interested insiders and scammers. But I have NO conflict of interest

Crypto-land is an eco-system of con artists, self-serving peddlers,
scammers, carnival barkers, charlatans, and outright criminals. While
every successful technological revolution includes some bubbles and
some scammers, most of the real ones – like the internet - create real
goods and services that billions of folks use around the world even after
the initial frothiness and bubble has burst. And the criminal and
scamming element in real technological revolutions is the exception,
not the systemic rule that it is in crypto land. Scams in crypto-currencies
were so widespread and systemic that the SEC had to create a fake
website that parodies the scammy ICO to warns investors of the
plethora of scams and criminal enterprises that infest and dominate
crypto land.[^18]

This scammy eco-system is consistent with the idiotic crypto jargon:
HODLers are suckers who have hold on their collapsing cryptocurrencies even after they lost 90% of their value; Lambos refer to the
crypto obsession with stealing investors' money to buy luxury energy
hogging cars; Whales are large early crypto billionaires who are stuck
with their fake wealth after the suckers of retails investors – who
bought into the FOMO of the peak 2017 bubbles – lost 90% of their
investments; those suckers are also called BagHolders. The entire
crypto jargon is not of a new industry developing a creative disruptive
technology but that of an industry of con artists, criminals, scammers
and carnival barkers.

Unlike all self-interested crypto insiders and scammers who talk and
spin their book 24/7 and use a media/press eco-system of pseudo -
journalists to spin their endless fake news I have zero position and
financial interest in this entire space. I have zero long or short position
in any coin or crypto-currency and any blockchain business venture.
And even my support of non-blockchain fin-tech is not driven from any
direct or indirect financial interest; I have zero exposure to fin-tech
ventures. Bitcoin or any crypto-asset could go "To The Moon" or crash
to zero and I would not make a penny either way. The only thing that is
at stake is my personal, intellectual and academic reputation.
