About Nouriel Roubini

My name is Nouriel Roubini and I am a Professor of Economics at the
Stern School of Business at New York University. I am an expert of the
global economy, international financial markets, asset and credit
bubbles and their bust, and the related financial crises. I was one of the
few economists warning about and predicting in advance the Global
Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 and I am one of the leading global scholars
on the topic of bubbles and financial crises. My most recent book
"Crisis Economics: A Crash Course in the Future of Finance" is a seminal
treatise on the topic of asset bubbles and financial crises. I have written
dozens of papers and other contributions on the topic of bubbles and
their bust and the causes and consequences of financial crises.



## Crypto Bubble (2017) and Crypto Apocalypse and Bust (2018)

It is clear by now that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies represent the
mother of all bubbles, which explains why literally every human being I
met between Thanksgiving and Christmas of 2017 asked me first if they
should buy them. Especially folks with zero financial literacy –
individuals who could not tell the difference between stocks and bonds –
went into a literal manic frenzy of Bitcoin and Crypto buying.
Scammers, swindlers, criminals, charlatans, insider whales and carnival
barkers (all conflicted insiders) tapped into clueless retail investors'
FOMO ("fear of missing out"), and took them for a ride selling them and
dumping on them scammy crappy assets at the peak that then went
into a bust and crash – in a matter of months - like you have not seen in
any history of financial bubbles.

A chart of Bitcoin prices compared to other famous historical bubbles
and scams – like Tulip-mania, the Mississippi Bubble, the South Sea
Bubble – shows that the price increase of Bitcoin and other crypto junkcoins was 2X or 3X bigger than previous bubbles and the ensuing
collapse and bust as fast and furious and deeper. Bitcoin rapidly
exploded in 2017 from $1k to 10K and then peaked almost at $20K in
December 2017 only to collapse to below $6k (down 70% from that
peak) in a matter of four months and it has been close to $6k since
then. And a 70% capital loss was a "good" deal compared to thousands
of alt-coins (otherwise better known as shitcoins) that have lost on
average 95% of their value since the peak. Actually calling this useless
vaporware garbage a "shitcoin" is a grave insult to manure that is a
most useful, precious and productive good as a fertilizer in agriculture.[^1]

[^1]: My apologies to the members of the Senate Banking Committee for using the scatological term "shitcoin" but the
term is standard in the crypto jargon and there are more than 500000 references to it in a Google search of this
technical term. See: <https://www.google.com/search?q=shitcoin>



Now that the crypto bloodbath is in full view the new refuge of the
crypto scoundrels is "blockchain", the technology underlying crypto
that is now alleged to be the cure of all global problems, including
poverty, famines and even diseases. But as discussed in detail below
blockchain is the most over-hyped - and least useful - technology in
human history: in practice it is nothing better than a glorified
spreadsheet or database.

The entire crypto-currency land has now gone into a crypto-apocalypse
as the mother and father of all bubbles has now gone bust. Since the
peak of the bubble late last year Bitcoin has fallen by about 70% in
value (depending on the week). And that is generous. Other leading
crypto-currencies such as Ether, EOS, Litecoin, XRP have fallen by over
80% (or more depending on the week). While thousands of other
crypto-currencies – literally scam-coins and scam-tokens – have fallen
in value between 90% and 99%. No wonder as a recent study showed
that 81% of all ICOs were scams in the first place, 11% of them are dead
or failing while only 8% of them are traded in exchanges. And out of
this 8% the top 10 coins traded – after Bitcoin – have lost between 83%
and 95% of their value since peak with an average loss of over 90%. This
is a true Crypt-Apocalypse. No wonder that a recent study this week
argued and conclude that the crypto industry is on the "brink of an
implosion".[^2]

No asset class in human history has ever experienced such a rapid
boom and total utter bust and implosion that includes thousands of
different crypto-assets.

## Crypto is not money, not scalable

To be a currency, Bitcoin – or any crypto-currencies - should be a
serviceable unit of account, means of payments, and a stable store of
value. It is none of those things. No one prices anything in Bitcoin. Few
retailers accept it. And it is a poor store of value, because its price can
fluctuate by 20-30% in a single day. And since its price has been so
unstable or volatile almost no merchant will ever use it as a means of
payment: the profit margin of any merchant can be wiped out in a
matter of minutes – if he or she accepts Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency –by the change in the dollar price of a crypto-currency. Proper
means of payments need to have stable purchasing power; otherwise
no one will ever use them.


As is typical of a financial bubble, investors were buying
cryptocurrencies not to use in transactions, but because they expected
them to increase in value. Indeed, if someone actually wanted to use
Bitcoin, they would have a hard time doing so. It is so 
[energy-intensive (and thus environmentally toxic) to produce](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/21/technology/bitcoin-mining-energy-consumption.html), and carries such high
transaction costs, that even Bitcoin conferences [do not accept it](https://slate.com/technology/2018/01/the-most-important-blockchain-conference-of-the-year-wont-take-bitcoin-for-last-minute-sales.html) as a
valid form of payment. Paying $55 dollars of transaction costs to buy a
$2 coffee cup is obviously never going to lead Bitcoin to become a
transaction currency.


Until now, Bitcoin's only real use has been to facilitate illegal activities
such as drug transactions, tax evasion, avoidance of capital controls, or
money laundering. Not surprisingly, G20 member states are now
working together to regulate cryptocurrencies and eliminate the
anonymity they supposedly afford, by requiring that all income - or
capital-gains-generating transactions be reported. Even the US Treasury
Secretary Steve Mnuchin has publicly stated that we cannot allow
crypto-currencies to become the next Swiss bank account. 

Since the invention of money thousands of years ago, there has never
been a monetary system with hundreds of different currencies
operating alongside one another. The entire point of money is that it
allows parties to transact without having to barter. But for money to
have value, and to generate economies of scale, only so many
currencies can operate at the same time.

In the US, the reason we do not use euros or yen in addition to dollars
is obvious: doing so would be pointless, and it would make the
economy far less efficient. The idea that hundreds of cryptocurrencies
could viably operate together not only contradicts the very concept of
money with a single numeraire that can be used for the price discovery
of the relative price of thousands of good; it is utterly idiotic as the use
of multiple numeraires is like the stone age of barter before money was
created.


## Supply of crypto is massive. Bitcoin is deflationary

But so, too, is the idea that even a single cryptocurrency could
substitute for fiat money. Cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value,
whereas fiat currencies certainly do, because they can be used to pay
taxes. Fiat currencies are legal tender and can be used and are used to
buy any good or service; and they can be used to pay for tax liabilities.
They are also protected from value debasement by central banks
committed to price stability; and if a fiat currency loses credibility, as in
some weak monetary systems with high inflation, it will be swapped
out for more stable foreign fiat currencies – like the dollar or the euro -
or real assets such as real estate, equities and possibly gold. Fiat money
also is not created out of thin air: these liabilities of a central bank such
as the Fed are backed by the Fed assets: their holdings of short term
and longer term Treasury securities (that have near AAA sovereign
credit status in the US) and holding of foreign reserves including gold
and other stable foreign currencies. The usual crypto critique of fiat
currencies that can be debased via inflation is nonsense: for the last 30
years commitment to inflation targeting in advanced economies and
most emerging markets has led to price stability (the 2% inflation target
of most central banks) and for the last decade the biggest problem of
central banks has been that achieving the inflation target of 2% after
the GFC has become extremely difficult as, in spite of unconventional
monetary policies, the inflation rate has systematically undershot its 2%
target.

Instead 99.9% all crypto-currencies instead have no backing whatsoever
of any sort and have no intrinsic value of any sort; and even the socalled "stable coins" have only partial backing at best with true US
dollars reserves or, like Tether, most likely no backing at all as there has
never been a proper audit of their accounts. 

As it happens, Bitcoin's supposed advantage is also its Achilles's heel,
because even if it actually did have a steady-state supply of 21 million
units, that would disqualify it as a viable currency. Unless the supply of
a currency tracks potential nominal GDP, prices will undergo deflation.

That means if a steady - state supply of Bitcoin really did gradually
replace a fiat currency, the price index of all goods and services would
continuously fall. By extension, any nominal debt contract denominated
in Bitcoin would rise in real value over time, leading to the kind of debt 
deflation that economist Irving Fisher believed [precipitated](https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/users/jcalhoun/Courses/Growth_of_American_Economy/Chapter_Supplemental_Readings/Chapter_23/Fisher-The_Debt_Deflation_Theory.pdf) the Great
Depression. At the same time, nominal wages in Bitcoin would increase
forever in real terms, regardless of productivity growth, adding further
to the likelihood of an economic disaster.

Worse, cryptocurrencies in general are based on a false premise.
According to its promoters, Bitcoin has a steady-state supply of 21
million units, so it cannot be debased like fiat currencies. But that claim
is clearly fraudulent, considering that it has already forked off into
several branches and spin-offs: Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. Ditto for
the various forks and spin-off of Ether from the Ethereum cartel. It took
a century for Coca Cola to create the new Coke and call the old one
Coke Classic. But it took three years to Ethereum to dump the first ETH
into Ethereum Classic and create and brand new spin-off, ETH. 

Moreover, hundreds of other cryptocurrencies are invented every day,
alongside scams known as "initial coin offerings," which are mostly
designed to [skirt securities laws](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/01/23/2197970/ico-regulator-anger-translator/). And their supply is created and
debased every day by pure fiat and in the most arbitrary way. So
crypto-currencies are creating crypto money supply and debasing it at a
much faster pace than any major central bank ever has. No wonder that
the average crypto-currency has lost 95% of its value in a matter of a
year. 

At least in the case of Bitcoin the increase in supply is controlled by a
rigorous mining process and the supply is capped – at the limit – to 21
million bitcoins. Instead, most other alt-coins starting with the leading
ETH, have an arbitrary supply that was created via pre-mining and presale; and the change of supply of that and thousands of other cryptocurrencies is now subject to arbitrary decision of self-appointed
"central bankers". 

And the biggest scam of all is the case of "stable coins" – starting with
Tether – that claimed to be pegged one to one to the US dollar but are 
not fully collateralized by an equal backing of true US dollars. Bitfinex -
behind the scammy Tether – has persistently refused to be properly
audited and its creation of fiat Tether has been systematically used to
prop up manipulate upward the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies according to a recent academic paper. [^3]

## Financial crises occurred well before fiat currencies and central banking; and are now less virulent thanks to central banks and fiat money.


Another totally false argument is that asset and credit bubbles are
caused by central banks and the existence of fiat currencies. Any
student of financial crises knows that asset and credit bubbles were
widespread before fiat currencies and central banks were created; see
for example Tulipmania, the Mississipi Bubble and the South Sea
Bubble. These bubbles and their busts were frequent, virulent and had
massive economic and financial costs including severe recessions,
deflations, defaults and financial crisis.

Central banks – instead – were initially created not to provide goods
price stability but rather to provide financial stability and avoid
the destructive bank, sovereign and currency runs that do occur when a
bubble goes bust. Indeed, the Fed was created in 1913 when the last of
many bubbles gone bust that had caused massive bank runs led to the
realization that an institution that could provide with lender of last
resort to the financial system was needed. That and the creation of
deposit insurance after the Great Depression is the reason why bank
runs are so rare. And the purpose of fiat currencies whose supply is
regulated by credible and independent central bank is to reduce the
frequency, virulence and severity of economic recessions, deflations
and asset and credit bubbles gone bust. And indeed the economic and
financial history of US and other countries shows that severe economic
recessions, depressions, deflations and financial crises are less frequent
and less costly after the creation of fiat currencies and central banks.

Crypto-currencies instead have not and will never have the tools to
pursue economic and financial stability. The few like Bitcoin whose
supply is truly constrained by an arbitrary mathematical rule will never
be able to stabilize recessions, deflations and financial crises; they will
rather lead to permanent and pernicious deflation. While the rest –
99% - have an arbitrary supply generation mechanism that is worse
than any fiat currency and, at the same time, will never be able to
provide either economic or price or financial stability. They will rather
be tools of massive financial instability if their use were to become
widespread.



## The real revolution in financial services is FinTech and it has nothing to do with Blockchain or Crypto


The financial-services industry has been undergoing a revolution. But
the driving force is not [overhyped blockchain](https://medium.com/@pavelkravchenko/decline-of-blockchain-hype-and-rise-of-a-common-sense-8de5789a794d) applications such as
Bitcoin. It is a revolution built on artificial intelligence, big data, and the
Internet of Things.

Already, thousands of real businesses are using these technologies to
disrupt every aspect of financial intermediation. Dozens of onlinepayment services – PayPal, Venmo, Square and so forth – have
hundreds of millions of daily users in the US. Billions more use similar
low cost, efficient digital payment systems all over the world: Alypay
and WeChat Pay in China; UPI-based systems in India; M-Pesa in Kenya
and Africa. And financial institutions are making precise lending
decisions in seconds rather than weeks, thanks to a wealth of online 
data on individuals and firms. With time, such data-driven
improvements in credit allocation could even eliminate cyclical creditdriven booms and busts.

Similarly, insurance underwriting, claims assessment and management,
and fraud monitoring have all become faster and more precise. And
actively managed portfolios are increasingly being replaced by passive
robo-advisers, which can perform just as well or better than conflicted,
high-fee financial advisers.

Now, compare this real and ongoing fintech revolution that has nothing
to do with blockchain or crypto-currencies with the record of
blockchain, which has existed for almost a decade, and still has only
one failing and imploding application: cryptocurrencies.



## Buterin's inconsistent trinity: crypto is not scalable, is not decentralized, is not secure


There is a deeper fundamental flaw and inconsistency in the
crypto/blockchain space. As Vitalik Buterin correctly wrote a while ago
there is a fundamental "inconsistent trinity" in blockchain: you cannot
have at the same time scalability, decentralization and security. 

Bitcoin, for example, is partially decentralized – even if its mining is now
massively centralized – but it is not scalable given its proof of work
(PoW) authentication mechanism – that allows only for 5 to 7
transactions a second. And it is secure – so far – but at the cost of no
scalability. And since its mining is now massively centralized – as an
oligopoly of miners now control its mining – its security is at risk. 

Supporters of crypto have been promising forever – Buterin spoke of
Proof of Stake (PoS) in 2013 – systems that are vastly scalable. But 
leaving aside that PoS is not live yet and Ethereum is still based on
PoW, the reality is that once Proof of Stake is properly launched it will
be massively centralized and thus not secure. The whole logic of PoS is
to give greater voting power to those who have a stake in a coin – those
who own it the most and mine it the most. But that leads to a massive
centralization problem. Even Bitcoin that is based on PoW has seen a
massive centralization and concentration of mining power in a small
oligopolistic group. This problem of concentration of mining power
among an oligopoly becomes much worse with PoS as those with
greater initial stake – and Ethereum is massively concentrated in
ownership of ETH – will get a greater stake over time. So the problems
of oligopolistic cartelization of mining power that is already very serious
in PoW will become exponentially worse in PoS. 

More generally, while cryptography scientists are busy inventing every
day another "consensus" mechanism and there are dozens of new ones
after PoW and PoS and their variant the reality is that – given Buterin’s
inconsistent trinity it will never be possible to create a consensus
mechanism that is scalable while also being decentralized and secure. 

One solution to the problem of scalability is to use many alt-coins
rather than increasing the block size of each blockchain; but that
solution is highly inefficient and is not secure. A second solution is to
increase the block size; but then nodes running on a smaller computer
or laptop would drop out of the system as they will not be able to store
every transaction or state. So you would end up relying on a small
number of super-computers for running the blockchain; so you end up
with an oligopoly with market power, concentration and lack of
security. A third solution is where most of the crypto industry is trying
to go, ie merge mining and variant of proof of stake. In this system
there are many chains but all such chains share the same mining power
or stake. But this approach increases the computational and storage 
demands on each miner by a massive factor that most miners will not
be able to support. So this solution is a backdoor way of increasing the
size of the blocks. Thus, it leads to only very few powerful miners to
participate into this proof of stake, ie participating in merge-mining
each chain. So it leads again to centralization, oligopolies of mining and
thus lack of security. 

Whichever way you try to slice it blockchain leads to centralization and
lack of security. And this fundamental problem when you try scalability
will never be resolved. Thus, no decentralized blockchain will ever be
able to achieve scalability that is critical to make it useful for large scale
financial or any other type of transactions. Indeed, even those
blockchains that do not have any scalability, like Bitcoin and those
based on PoW, have massive mining concentration problems. The
nature of mining implies that any form of mining has economies of
scale that require massive scale – think of the massive energy hogging
mining factories of crypto-land – and lead to massive oligopolistic
concentration of power and lack of security. 

With the centralization of power comes a serious problem of lack of
security, starting with 51% attacks. Supporters of crypto argue that it
would not be in the interest of an oligopoly of miners to start a 51% as
it would destroy their source of income/fees. But leaving aside that
such an attack would allow them to steal the underlying assets - worth
is some cases dozens of billions of dollars as in the case of BTC. The
main problem is any oligopolistic cartel will end up behaving like an
oligopoly: using its market power to jack up prices, fees for transactions
and increase its profit margins. Indeed, as concentration of mining has
increased over the last year transaction costs of crypto – as measured
by miners’ fees divided by number of transactions – have skyrocketed. 



## No security in crypto-currencies

So even PoW that is not scalable leads to concentration/centralization
and thus lack of security. PoS and other authentication mechanisms
that are scalable are much worse: bigger concentrated oligopolistic
cartels and thus lack of security.

Also 51% attacks are not a theoretic possibility that is impossible in
practice. Dozens of successful 51% attacks have occurred recently. In
smaller coins with a small market capitalization you don’t even need a
51% hash power to mount a successful 51% attack. And since market
cap is low a few hundreds of thousands of dollars – or at best a couple
of millions – are sufficient to mount a successful 51% attack whose gain
is a 10 to 20X multiple of the cost of the attack. No wonder that dozens
of successful 51% attack have occurred recently against smaller cryptocurrencies. 

Fundamental flaws of lack of security in crypto land go well beyond the
fact that mining is highly concentrated in oligopolies in shady and nontransparent and unsecure jurisdictions – China, Russia, Belarus,
Georgia, etc. It also goes beyond the possibility and reality of massive
and regular 51% attacks.

There is a deeper and more fundamentals set of security flaws in crypto
land. Conventional payment systems based on fiat currencies, central
banks and private banks are scalable and secure but centralized; so
they resolve Buterin's inconsistent trinity principle by giving up
decentralization and relying on trusted permissioned authorities to
resolve the "double spend" problem. 

Instead, blockchains and cryptocurrencies not only are not scalable and
are massively centralized; they are also massively not secure.
When I use traditional financial systems based on fiat currencies there
are many levels and layers of security. First I rely on institutions with a
reputation and credibility built over time; there is also deposit
insurance that guarantees the value of my deposits; there is the lender
of last resort role of central bank to avoid runs on solvent but illiquid
banks; sometimes even there is even the bailout of systemically
important too-big-to-fail (TBTF) institutions with provisos to control this
TBTF moral hazard. More importantly, a depositor or credit card holder
is made whole with little effort when fraudulent transaction occur and
someone tries to steal your money or make a fraudulent charge on
your credit card. Society pays a small fee – in a number of ways – to
ensure such safety but depositors and credit card holders are happy to
pay such a modest fee in exchange for transaction security. So while
many breaches of security may occur –as there are main weak points in
the system – the system is secure and individual users of the system are
also secure.


In crypto land instead there are none of these institutions that provide
security: no deposit insurance, no lender of last resort backstop, no
insurance of hacked and stolen funds. And the breaches of security are
massive and escalating. It is now clear that while Bitcoin has not been
hacked yet the centralized exchanges that hold the cryptocurrencies of
millions of depositors can be and have been hacked on a regular scale.
And once your crypto assets are stolen they vanish in the vast
anonymous void of crypto and cannot be found and retrieved any
more. The vast hacking of centralized exchanges has led to the
developments of dozens of decentralized exchanges (DEX) but 99% of
all trading is on centralized exchanges and some security flaws of DEX
imply that even the so called "secure" DEX are not secure at all. Once a
hacker steals your private key - whether it is stored on an online wallet, 
laptop, phone, computer or tablet or centralized exchange your crypto
wealth is stolen and gone forever. 

Given these massive security problems of crypto the solutions to these
severe security problems are all variants of going back to the stone age:
do not put your long private key – that no human can memorize ever –
on any digital device but rather write it down on a piece of paper and
hide it in a hole where hopefully no one will find it or no insect or rat
will destroy it. Or spend a fortune to put your crypto assets into "cold
storage", ie a digital storage that is disconnected from anything online.
The latter is the stone age equivalent of hiding your wealth into deep
caves that cannot be found by anyone. But leaving aside the cost of
such stone age security solutions the implication becomes that your
crypto wealth – hidden in deep cold storage – cannot be easily traded
or used for transactions of any sort. This is the contemporary
equivalent of mining gold deep from the ground and then hiding it in
the form of gold ingots back deep in the ground. 

Even such security solutions are not safe: criminals who know that
access to your private key is access to your entire crypto wealth forever
are now specializing into gunpoint robberies of crypto investors and
whales (also known as "crypto robberies"). At gunpoint you are forced
to provide your private key and then your wealth is gone for good. No
wonder that crypto conferences have entire sessions devoted to secure
your insecure crypto assets.

Traditional banking systems have found secure solutions to such
criminal security problems: even if a robber forces you at gunpoint to
reveal the pin of your ATM card the amount of cash that can be
withdrawn is limited to a small amount; similarly wire transfer of a
significant size are subject to various forms of identity verification. o
there is no way that your entire wealth can be stolen with a click as it 
happens daily in crypto land. While crypto relies on stone age
technologies and cannot even resolve such security problems.


## Decentralization is a self-serving ideology

Blockchain's ideology is politically born out of the same mentality as
libertarian right wing conspiracies or extreme left anarchism: all
governments, central banks, moneys, institutions, banks, corporations,
entities with reputation and credibility build over centuries are evil
centralized concentrations of power that literally need to be destroyed. 

So the utopian crypto future will be one of libertarian decentralization
of all economic activity, transactions and human interactions.
Everything will end up on a public decentralized distributed permissionless trustless ledger; or better millions of ledgers on computers that are
now already consuming more energy than Canada to verify and confirm
transactions without the use of evil centralized institutions. This
extreme right wing ideology of crypto has been studied in detail in the
academic book by David Golumbia "The Politics of Bitcoin: Software As
Right Wing Extremism". [^4]

[^4]: See <https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-politics-of-bitcoin>

But the reality is just the opposite: a bunch of self-serving greedy white
men – very few women or minorities are allowed in the blockchain
space – have pretended to create billions of wealth out of nowhere
while pretending to care about billions of poor and unbanked human
around the world. It is a total pretense as crypto-land is the most
centralized scam in human history where greed for Lambos and
ostentatious consumption is greater than any Gordon Gecko ever. 

There are hundreds of stories of greedy crypto-criminals raising billions
of dollars with scammy white papers that are nothing but vaporware 
and then literally stealing these billions to buy Lambos, expensive cars,
villas in the Caribbean and the French Riviera. These large scale
criminals stealing dozens of billions make the small and petty Wolf of
New York robbing small investors in criminal penny stock manipulation
schemes looks an amateur. 

But the most shameful of such near-criminals is a crypto guru –that was
formerly investigated for pedophilia and who has put his home and
operation – together with a group of crypto scammers - in Puerto Rico
after a devastating hurricane that killed thousands and nearly
destroyed the island. 

Under the high-flatulent pretense of wanting to help the millions who
lost homes and their livelihood to the hurricane by using "blockchain"
and new crappy crypto-currencies these literal blood-suckers live in
super-luxury mega mansions in the island and use the island's tax laws
to enrich themselves and avoid paying their federal taxes. They are
emblematic of a widespread crypto culture that shamelessly pretends
to care about the billions of poor and unbanked just to enrich itself. At
least the Wolf of New York had no pretense of wanting save the world,
end global poverty and the tragic misery of a Puerto Rico devastated by
a hurricane. 


## Decentralization is a myth: massive centralization and concentration of oligopolistic power and cartels among miners, exchanges, developers, wealth holders


The reality is one of a massive centralization of power among miners,
exchanges, developers and wealth holders, the total opposite of the lie
of a decentralized system.

First, miners are massively centralized as the top four among them
control three quarters of mining and behave like any oligopolist: jacking
up transaction costs to increase their fat profit margins. And when it
comes to security most of these miners are in non-transparent and
authoritarian countries such as Russia and China. So we are supposed
not to trust central banks or banks when it comes to financial
transactions but rather a bunch of shady anonymous concentrated
oligopolists in jurisdictions where there is little rule of law?

A recent study by a scholar at Princeton University is aptly titled "The
Looming Threat of China: An Analysis of Chinese Influence on Bitcoin". [^5]
In summary the conclusions of this paper are as follows: 

> As Bitcoin's
> popularity has grown over the decade since its creation, it has become
> an increasingly attractive target for adversaries of all kinds. One of the
> most powerful potential adversaries is the country of China, which has
> expressed adversarial positions regarding the cryptocurrency and
> demonstrated powerful capabilities to influence it. In this paper, we
> explore how China threatens the security, stability, and viability of
> Bitcoin through its dominant position in the Bitcoin ecosystem, political
> and economic control over domestic activity, and control over its
> domestic Internet infrastructure. We explore the relationship between
> China and Bitcoin, document China's motivation to undermine Bitcoin,
> and present a case study to demonstrate the strong influence that
> China has over Bitcoin. Finally, we systematize the class of attacks that
> China can deploy against Bitcoin to better understand the threat China
> poses. We conclude that China has mature capabilities and strong
> motives for performing a variety of attacks against Bitcoin.

Everything that this study argues about the nefarious impact of China
on Bitcoin can be said and applied to any other crypto-currency and to
the role of Russia in the crypto eco-system.

Second, all trading is centralized as 99% of all trading occurs on
centralized exchanges while hundreds of decentralized exchanges have
no trading, no liquidity are collapsing. And centralized exchanges are
being hacked daily as there is not security in keeping crypto assets in a
wallet; and once hacked your wealth is gone forever. 

Third, development is centralized as Vitalik Buterin – creator of
Ethereum – is named as "benevolent dictator for life". And there is
nothing immutable in the "code is law" motto as the developers are
police, prosecutors and judges: when something goes wrong in one of
their buggy "smart" pseudo-contracts [^6] and massive hacking occurs,
they simply change the code [^7] and "fork" a failing coin into another one
by arbitrary fiat [^8]
, revealing the entire "trustless" enterprise to have
been untrustworthy from the start.

[^8]: See: <https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/ethereum-hack-blockchain-fork-bitcoin-1.3719009>


"Smart Contracts" are neither smart nor contracts. As a recent study
has shown "smart contracts on Ethereum are worse than even nonfinancial commercial code; as of May 2016, Ethereum contracts
averaged 100 obvious bugs (so obvious a machine could spot them) per
1000 lines of code. (For comparison, Microsoft code averages 15 bugs
per 1000 lines, NASA code around 0 per 500,000 lines.)" [^9]

Fourth, wealth in crypto-land is more concentrated than in North Korea
where the inequality Gini coefficient is 0.86 (it is 0.41 in the quite
unequal US): the Gini coefficient for Bitcoin is an astonishing [0.88](https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-inequality-2014-1).

Quite a feat to create an asset class where inequality is greater than
that of Kim Jong-un land. 

So decentralization is just a total myth invented by a bunch of whales
whose wealth is fake; now that the retail suckers who bought at the
peak have literally lost their shirts these crypto "whales" are fake
billionaires as liquefying their wealth would crash the price of the
"asset" to zero.

The comparison with the early days of the internet is non-sense as even
the early internet in the early 1990s saw a rapid boom of applications
and explosion of user adoption: email became widespread and
thousands of useful website used by millions of people for useful
purpose sprang overnight. The boom in web sites creation was so vast,
rapid and massive that early on directories of such web site – such as
the start of Yahoo – and search engines became necessary to navigate
the richness of information of the World Wide Web (WWW). 

The WWW went live in 1991 and by 2000 – nine years later - it already
had 738 million users; and by 2015 the number of users was 3.5 billion.

Crypto has been around for over a decade now and in 2018 the number
of crypto wallets was only 22 million and out of this figure the number
of active bitcoin users is only between 2.9 and 5.9 million and falling.
And the number of crypto transactions has collapsed by at least 75%
between 2017 and 2018.

Successful new technologies have a few key features: exponential
increase of the number of users, exponential increase of the number of
transaction, sharp and persistent fall of transaction costs. That is the
history of the internet – almost one billion users in a decade since start
and billions of billions of transactions in the first decade – and is also
the history of financial markets where trading activity – say in equity
markets – includes an exponential increase in users, exponential and
permanent increase in number of transactions and a sharp fall in
transaction costs (as measured by falling bid-ask spreads and by the
collapse of brokers' fee for equity transactions).

Crypto land is just the opposite: the number of users in a decade is still
barely 22 million globally and, after the bust of crypto in 2018, the
active users are a fraction of that number; the number of transactions
on crypto exchanges in 2018 has collapsed and is down between 75%
and 80%; same for the size of transaction values given the collapse of
crypto asset prices; and transaction costs are surging through the roof
rather than falling as measured by the total value of miners revenue as
a share of the number of transactions. And after over a decade crypto
land has not a single killer app. 

So crypto and blockchain are not like the early years of the internet that
was booming in every dimension in its first decade; it is instead literally
collapsing and imploding in every possible dimension. It is a failing set
of technologies.


## ICOs are not compliant securities when they aren't outright scams



Initial coin offerings have become the most common way to finance
cryptocurrency ventures, of which there are now [nearly 1,600](https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/) and
rising. In exchange for your dollars, pounds, euros, or other currency,
an ICO issues digital "tokens," or "coins," that may or may not be used
to purchase some specified good or service in the future.


Thus it is little wonder that, according to the ICO advisory firm Satis
Group, [81% of ICOs are scams](https://medium.com/satis-group/cryptoasset-market-update-b678aeda4c5e) created by con artists, charlatans, and
swindlers looking to take your money and run. It is also little wonder
that only 8% of cryptocurrencies end up being traded on an exchange,
meaning that 92% of them failed. It would appear that ICOs serve little
purpose other than to skirt securities laws that exist to protect
investors from being cheated.


If you invest in a conventional (non-crypto) business, you are afforded a
variety of legal rights – to dividends if you are a shareholder, to interest
if you are a lender, and to a share of the enterprise's assets should it
default or become insolvent. Such rights are enforceable because
securities and their issuers must be registered with the state.


Moreover, in legitimate investment transactions, issuers are required
to disclose accurate financial information, business plans, and potential
risks. There are restrictions limiting the sale of certain kinds of high-risk
securities to qualified investors only. And there are anti-moneylaundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations to prevent
tax evasion, concealment of ill-gotten gains, and other criminal
activities such as the financing of terrorism.

In the Wild West of ICOs, most cryptocurrencies are issued in breach of
these laws and regulations, under the pretense that they are not 
securities at all but rather "security tokens" [^10]. Hence, most ICOs deny
investors any legal rights whatsoever. They are generally accompanied
by vaporous "white papers" instead of concrete business plans. Their
issuers are often anonymous and untraceable. And they skirt all AML
and KYC regulations, leaving the door open to any criminal investor.

[^10]: We will discuss below the other scam of so-called "utility token".


Jay Clayton, the chairman of US Securities and Exchange Commission,
recently [made it clear](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-ico-tokens-regulated-securities-205650102.html) that he regards all cryptocurrencies as securities,
with the exception of the first mover, Bitcoin, which he considers a
commodity. The implication is that even Ethereum and Ripple – the
second- and third-largest crypto-assets – are currently operating as
unregistered securities [^11]. Gary Gensler, a former chairman of the
Commodities and Futures Trading Commission who now teaches a
course on [blockchain](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/blockchain-technology-limited-applications-by-nouriel-roubini-and-preston-byrne-2018-03) (the technology underlying cryptocurrencies) at
MIT, has also [suggested](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-23/ether-ripple-may-be-securities-former-cftc-head-gensler-says) as much.


[^11]: A legal scholar such as Preston Byrne has shown that Ripple Labs has created XRP; see <https://prestonbyrne.com/2018/09/20/for-the-last-time-ripple-created-xrp/>


And legal scholars such as Preston Byrne have not only confirmed that
they Ether was created makes it a clear security. [^12] They have also
shown that the creation of Ethereum may have been a criminal insider
con job where a small group of whale – starting with the billionaires
who created this scheme – pretended to make a market-based "presale" of Ether but they instead sold to themselves – most likely at
bargain basement prices – a great fraction of the ETH created in the
pre-sale. And so far regulators have done nothing to investigate, let
alone, prosecute such a cartelized scam.

## Tokenization: cartels aimed to gouge consumers. No numeraire and return to barter

So hundreds of ICOs that have raised billions of dollars from investors in
recent years have been technically illegal as they are non-compliant
securities hiding under the label of "security tokens". Even worse, the
business model behind most of the remaining ones – the so-called
"utility tokens" - is simply to fleece customers, as Izabella Kaminska of
the _Financial Times_ and Martin Walker of the Center for EvidenceBased Management recently demonstrated in a [report](http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/treasury-committee/digital-currencies/written/82032.html) for the UK
House of Commons Treasury Committee.


In normal business transactions, customers can buy goods and service
with conventional currencies. But in an ICO, customers must convert
that currency by buying into a limited pool of tokens in order to make a
purchase. No legitimate business that is trying to maximize profits
would require its customers to jump through such hoops of first buying
an "utility token" before being able to transact goods or services.

In fact, the only reason to restrict a purchase to token-holders is to
create an illegal cartel of service providers who are safe from price
competition and in a position to gouge their customers.
Consider Dentacoin, a ridiculous cryptocurrency that can be spent only
on dental services (and which almost no dentist actually accepts). It
would be hard to come up with a better illustration of why business
cartels are illegal in all civilized countries.


Of course, the crypto-cartels would counter that customers who incur
the cost of buying a token will benefit if that token appreciates in value.
But this makes no sense. If the price of the token rises above the
market value of the good or service being provided, then no one would
buy the token. The only plausible reason for forcing the use of a token,
then, is to hike prices or bilk investors.

Beyond facilitating illegal activity, crypto-tokens obfuscate the pricediscovery benefits that come when a single currency operates as a unit
of account. In a crypto-utopia, every single good and service would 
have its own distinct token, and average consumers would have no way
to judge the relative prices of different – or even similar – goods and
services. Nor would they have any real certainty about a token's
purchasing power, given the volatility of crypto-token prices.

Imagine living in a country where instead of simply using the national
currency, you had to rely on 200 other world currencies to purchase
different goods and services. There would be widespread price
confusion, and you would have to eat the cost of converting one
volatile currency into another every time you wanted to buy anything.

The fact that everyone within a given country or jurisdiction uses the
same currency is precisely what gives money its value. Money is a
public good that allows individuals to enter into free exchange without
having to resort to the kind of imprecise, inefficient bartering on which
traditional societies depended.

That is precisely where the ICO charlatans would effectively take us –
not to the futuristic world of "[The Jetsons](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055683/)," but to the modern Stone
Age world - that is worse than "[The Flintstones]()https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053502/" – who at least used
clam shells as their money and understood the importance of a single
numeraire - where all transactions occur through the barter of different
tokens or goods. It is time to recognize their utopian rhetoric for what it
is: self-serving nonsense meant to separate credulous investors from
their hard-earned savings.

## Crypto is corrupt eco-system full of charlatans, con-men, self-interested insiders and scammers. But I have NO conflict of interest

Crypto-land is an eco-system of con artists, self-serving peddlers,
scammers, carnival barkers, charlatans, and outright criminals. While
every successful technological revolution includes some bubbles and
some scammers, most of the real ones – like the internet - create real
goods and services that billions of folks use around the world even after
the initial frothiness and bubble has burst. And the criminal and
scamming element in real technological revolutions is the exception,
not the systemic rule that it is in crypto land. Scams in crypto-currencies
were so widespread and systemic that the SEC had to create a fake
website that parodies the scammy ICO to warns investors of the
plethora of scams and criminal enterprises that infest and dominate
crypto land.[^18]

This scammy eco-system is consistent with the idiotic crypto jargon:
HODLers are suckers who have hold on their collapsing cryptocurrencies even after they lost 90% of their value; Lambos refer to the
crypto obsession with stealing investors' money to buy luxury energy
hogging cars; Whales are large early crypto billionaires who are stuck
with their fake wealth after the suckers of retails investors – who
bought into the FOMO of the peak 2017 bubbles – lost 90% of their
investments; those suckers are also called BagHolders. The entire
crypto jargon is not of a new industry developing a creative disruptive
technology but that of an industry of con artists, criminals, scammers
and carnival barkers.

Unlike all self-interested crypto insiders and scammers who talk and
spin their book 24/7 and use a media/press eco-system of pseudo -
journalists to spin their endless fake news I have zero position and
financial interest in this entire space. I have zero long or short position
in any coin or crypto-currency and any blockchain business venture.
And even my support of non-blockchain fin-tech is not driven from any
direct or indirect financial interest; I have zero exposure to fin-tech
ventures. Bitcoin or any crypto-asset could go "To The Moon" or crash
to zero and I would not make a penny either way. The only thing that is
at stake is my personal, intellectual and academic reputation.
