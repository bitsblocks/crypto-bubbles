About Nouriel Roubini

My name is Nouriel Roubini and I am a Professor of Economics at the
Stern School of Business at New York University. I am an expert of the
global economy, international financial markets, asset and credit
bubbles and their bust, and the related financial crises. I was one of the
few economists warning about and predicting in advance the Global
Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 and I am one of the leading global scholars
on the topic of bubbles and financial crises. My most recent book
"Crisis Economics: A Crash Course in the Future of Finance" is a seminal
treatise on the topic of asset bubbles and financial crises. I have written
dozens of papers and other contributions on the topic of bubbles and
their bust and the causes and consequences of financial crises.
